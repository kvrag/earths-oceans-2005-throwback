  <p>Do you want to know something crazy? Human beings know more about outer space than about the deepest oceans on Earth. And they're right here, waiting to be explored! </p>

<h3 id="deep">How Deep is the Ocean?</h3>
  <p>The ocean covers more than half of the Earth's surface, and some areas of the ocean are shallower or deeper than others.</p>
  <p>In 1960, humans (a crew of two aboard the Bathyscaphe <em>Trieste</em>, reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is 35,797 feet below the surface. This is the deepest known point in the ocean.</p>

  <table border="1" bgcolor="lightgrey">
  <tr>
    <th>Zone</th>
    <th>Depth</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epipelagic</td>
    <td>< 650 feet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mesopelagic</td>
    <td>650&ndash;3,300 feet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bathypelagic</td>
    <td>3,300&ndash;13,000 feet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Abyssopelagic</td>
    <td>> 13,000 feet</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>As you can see in the above table, the ocean is divided into different zones based on depth. This helps scientists classify the conditions (light, pressure, salinity, etc.) and the kinds of creatures (animal and plant life) present in each zone. </p>
  <p>The deep ocean is very dark, because light cannot penetrate below about 650 feet down. The pressure is also very high in the deepest parts of the ocean, which is part of why it is so difficult to explore.</p>

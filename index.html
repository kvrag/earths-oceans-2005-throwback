  <p>Do you want to know something crazy? Human beings know more about outer space than about the deepest oceans on Earth. And they're right here, waiting to be explored! </p>

<h3 id="deep">How Deep is the Ocean?</h3>
  <p>The ocean covers more than half of the Earth's surface, and some areas of the ocean are shallower or deeper than others.</p>
  <p>In 1960, humans (a crew of two aboard the Bathyscaphe <em>Trieste</em>, reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, which is 35,797 feet below the surface. This is the deepest known point in the ocean.</p>

    <table border="1" bgcolor="lightgrey">
    <tr>
      <th>Zone</th>
      <th>Depth</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Epipelagic</td>
      <td>&lt; 650 feet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mesopelagic</td>
      <td>650&ndash;3,300 feet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bathypelagic</td>
      <td>3,300&ndash;13,000 feet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Abyssopelagic</td>
      <td>> 13,000 feet</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see in the above table, the ocean is divided into different zones based on depth. This helps scientists classify the conditions (light, pressure, salinity, etc.) and the kinds of creatures (animal and plant life) present in each zone. </p>
    <p>The deep ocean is very dark, because light cannot penetrate below about 650 feet down. The pressure is also very high in the deepest parts of the ocean, which is part of why it is so difficult to explore.</p>

<h3 id="life">Deep Sea Life</h3>
  <p>At one time in history, scientists assumed that not many creatures could survive in the deep ocean. How wrong they were! Nowadays, we know that there is <em>lots</em> of life down there, and a lot of it is super creepy. Most fish living in the deep ocean are small, with slow metabolic rates and large eyes to capture as much light as possible. They are also rather jelly-like, and some use tentacles to feed.</p>
  <p>Organic matter from the ocean's surface falls slowly down to the depths below and is called <em>marine snow</em>. This is the main food source for many deep-sea creatures, and it is scarce. However, larger "food falls" like whale carcasses happen fairly often, and lots of sea creatures feed off of these food sources.</p>
  <p>In some places on the bottom of the deep sea, <em>hydrothermic vents</em> bring a source of heat and light apart from the sun, which helps to create a more diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="explore">Exploration</h3>
  <p>The reason that human knowledge of the deep ocean is so limited is because it is very difficult to explore. Even in the mesopelagic zone, which is the second-most shallow zone of the ocean, the pressure is too high to just go poking around down there. Specialized vessels are necessary to spend even a small amount of time in the deep ocean.</p>
  <p>To complicate things even more, deep ocean life has adapted to this extremely high pressure &mdash; so these creatures die and get all destroyed and whatnot when we try to bring them up to the surface to study them.</p>

<h3 id="info">More Information</h3>
  <p>All of the information on this page is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea" target="_blank">Wikipedia's Deep Sea page</a>. However, there are many other resources out there if you'd like more information about the deep ocean.</p>
  <p>One such resource is the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/deep-sea" target="_blank">Ocean Portal</a>. This page is very easy to navigate and share on social media sites. Both the left-side navigation and the share buttons come with you as you scroll down the page, so you can easily access different sections of content with the anchor links (as on this page). This page also has a very clear order of importance among the different header styles, though some of the shades of blue aren't different enough to contrast properly. Additionally, their octopus photo is the bomb dot com.</p>
  <p>Behind the scenes of this website, all of the content is arranged semantically with HTML and styled with CSS. This will make it easier for accessibility programs to parse the web page, which is a very good thing for web developers to keep in mind.</p>
